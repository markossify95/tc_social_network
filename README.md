# TC Social Network

This project is a demonstration of usage of, what I found to be, 
the one of the best stacks in monolithic Python3 world. It's all-python, 
with focus on the clean REST API, code reusability and useful shortcuts here and there.

## Getting Started

Just clone this bad boy and spin it up.

### Prerequisites

#### Backend
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (tested on 18.x)
* [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (>= 1.20)

#### Bot client
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) (>= 3.6)
* [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) (>= 2.21.0)

### Config

As far as backend configuration goes, you can switch the key for [```clearbit```](https://clearbit.com/) and [```hunter.io```](https://hunter.io/) inside ```docker-compose.yml```:

```
    environment:
      - CLEARBIT_KEY=<YOUR_CLEARBIT_API_KEY>
      - HUNTER_API_KEY=<YOUR_HUNTER_API_KEY>
```

For bot client, you can edit the configuration file ```bot_client/config.json```. 
Once there, you can, for example, change the source of emails for user registration (```source_domain_name``` key) 


### Spinning up and usage

You can start the ```backend``` by the commands provided below.
PS. hope you are running on *nix system. :)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/markossify95/tc_social_network/
$ cd tc_social_network
$ docker-compose up --build
```

Once the backend is active, you can find those great DRF's autogenerated forms (api-root) at ```localhost:8000```

You can (if preffered) also use [```postman```](https://www.getpostman.com/) schema for testing the API. The schema can 
be found in the root of the project (```collection.json```)

To start the ```bot client``` (when the backend gets active) and assuming that you are currently in project root:

```
cd bot_client && python3 main.py
```

## Built With

#### Backend

* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - The web framework used
    * [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) - hands down the best toolkit for REST API development in Django
    * [django-rest-framework-simplejwt](https://github.com/davesque/django-rest-framework-simplejwt) - excellent JWT auth plugin
    * [django-filter](https://django-filter.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html) - Django filtering on steroids
    * [PyHunter](https://github.com/VonStruddle/PyHunter) - hunter.io client for Python
    * [clearbit-python](https://github.com/clearbit/clearbit-python/tree/master/clearbit) - clearbit client for Python
    
* [Celery](http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/index.html#) - Distributed task queue
    * [Redis](https://redis.io/) - NoSQL db, used here as a message broker
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - DBMS

#### Client bot (pure Python)
* [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) - The best http client lib. Ever.

for unselfishly giving their knowledge and valuable time to improve the quality
of software written in Python, but also the quality of the Python itself.
